# merge

One command to land the current branch and reset to a clean `master`: confirm the PR's checks are green, merge it, then switch back to `master`, pull, and delete the merged branch — so there's no juggling before the next task.

This skill is **Concertable-specific**. It encodes how this repo actually merges (see "Repo facts" below) so you don't rediscover it each time.

## Repo facts (why this skill exists)

- **`master` is protected by a merge queue** (ruleset `17393335`, `ALLGREEN`). A plain `gh pr merge --merge` does **not** work: gh tries to enqueue via auto-merge, and the repo has `allow_auto_merge` **off**, so it fails with `Auto merge is not allowed for this repository`.
- **Admins have `bypass_mode: always`** in that ruleset, so the working merge path is an **admin merge**: `gh pr merge <n> --merge --admin`. That is the sanctioned path here, not a policy hack.
- **`--delete-branch` is rejected while the merge queue is enabled** (`Cannot use --delete-branch when merge queue enabled`) — delete the branch separately, after.
- **`e2e-api-tests` / `e2e-ui-tests` are merge-queue-only** (`if: github.event_name == 'merge_group'`). On the PR itself they show **`skipping`** — that is expected, not a failure. The PR-level gate you wait on is `build` + the five `carve-*` jobs + `unit-tests` + `integration-tests`.
- **An admin merge bypasses the queue, so the e2e suites do NOT run on merge.** That's fine for zero-/low-behaviour-change work (most of what this skill is for). If the change is **massive or behaviourally risky** (payments, settlement, the event/projection chain, registration/login, broadly cross-cutting), run E2E **before** invoking this skill — via the `e2e-ui-regress` / `e2e-debug` skills — and only merge once it's green. This skill does not run E2E itself.

## Steps

1. **Find the PR for the current branch.**
   ```
   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD                 # current branch (must not be master)
   gh pr view --json number,state,title,url --jq '{number,state,title,url}'
   ```
   - If on `master`, or there's no PR for the branch, **stop** and say so — there's nothing to merge.
   - If the PR is already `MERGED`, skip to step 5 (sync master). If `CLOSED`, stop and report.

2. **Make sure the branch is actually pushed and current.**
   - If `git status` shows uncommitted changes, or the local branch is ahead of its remote, **stop** and tell the user to commit/push first (or do it with the `commit` / `push` skills if they ask). Don't merge a PR that's missing local work.

3. **Wait for the PR checks to reach a terminal state, then verify green.**
   - Poll `gh pr checks <n>` until **no** check is `pending`. Prefer the `Monitor` tool with an until-loop so you're notified instead of busy-waiting, e.g.:
     ```
     while true; do out=$(gh pr checks <n> 2>&1);
       pend=$(echo "$out" | awk -F'\t' '$2=="pending"' | wc -l);
       fail=$(echo "$out" | awk -F'\t' '$2=="fail"'    | wc -l);
       if [ "$fail" -gt 0 ]; then echo "FAILED"; echo "$out" | awk -F'\t' '$2=="fail"{print $1}'; break; fi;
       if [ "$pend" -eq 0 ]; then echo "ALL-TERMINAL"; break; fi;
       sleep 20; done
     ```
   - **Treat `skipping` as pass** (the e2e merge-queue jobs). The real pass set is `build`, `carve-auth/payment/search/b2b/customer`, `unit-tests`, `integration-tests`.
   - **If any check failed:** do **not** merge. Report which job failed and route to the matching debug skill (`integration-debug` for unit/integration, `e2e-api-debug` / `e2e-ui-debug` for E2E, or read the failing job's log for `build`/`carve-*`). Drive it green, push, and re-run this skill.

4. **Merge (admin bypass — the working path here).**
   ```
   gh pr merge <n> --merge --admin
   ```
   - **No `--delete-branch`** (the queue rejects it).
   - If the harness's auto-mode classifier blocks the agent from running `--admin` on its own PR, don't fight it — hand the user the exact line to run themselves with the `!` prefix: `! gh pr merge <n> --merge --admin`, then continue once it's merged.
   - **Verify** it landed: `gh pr view <n> --json state,mergeCommit --jq '{state,mergeCommit:.mergeCommit.oid}'` should show `MERGED`.

5. **Return to a clean, up-to-date master.**
   ```
   git checkout master
   git pull --ff-only origin master
   git branch -d <merged-branch>            # local cleanup (safe: only deletes if merged)
   git push origin --delete <merged-branch> # remote cleanup (the queue blocked gh's --delete-branch)
   ```
   - If `git branch -d` refuses ("not fully merged") — usually because the merge was a squash/merge-commit and the local tip differs — confirm the PR really is `MERGED`, then it's safe to `git branch -D`. Don't force-delete an unmerged branch.

## Final summary

One short report: the PR that merged (number + merge commit), that `master` is synced, and that the branch is cleaned up — i.e. **ready for the next task**. If you stopped early (failed check, unpushed work, blocked merge), say exactly what's blocking and what's needed.

Keep it terminal: verify green → merge → sync master → summarize → stop. No preamble. Plain `git`/`gh` only (personal repo — never the work PR/ADO skills).
